## Schiavinato Sharing HTML Tool (Planned)

This directory will contain the reference **self-contained HTML/JavaScript tool** described in Section 5.1 of `WHITEPAPER.md`:

- A single-page application (e.g. `schiavinato-sharing.html`) designed to run fully offline on an air-gapped machine.  
- Features will include guided sharding and recovery workflows, a manual sharding helper, and a Lagrange coefficient calculator.

At this stage the whitepaper and test vectors are the primary artifacts of the project. The HTML tool will be developed iteratively and released under the MIT License as it matures.
